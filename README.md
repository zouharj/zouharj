Hi, I’m __Jan Zouhar__, a statistican/econometrician/musician from Prague.

I am an Associate Professor at Prague University of Economics and Business, Department of Econometrics. 
I make my living mostly by performing data analyses in research projects of my smart and wonderful colleagues 
in the fields of entrepreneurship, ornithology, biological conservation, land use and improvement, 
politology, archaeology, and perhaps some others.

And I teach. I teach a lot and like it a lot. That is what made me stay in academia in the first place. 
Now that I think of it, I am in charge of a whole bachelor's degree in Data Analytics. Who would have thought this possible. :)

Last but not least, I also try to earn money as a gigging musician. 
I'm in several bands, playing at weddings and corporate events. 
Not much of a github thing, this one, though...
